            <strong>Personalization:</strong> A recommendation system can personalize recommendations based on a student's specific interests, academic background, and career goals. This level of personalization can save students time and effort in searching for relevant information.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Comprehensive:</strong> A recommendation system can provide students with a comprehensive view of available courses, programs, and resources that they may not have been aware of through a Google search or counseling.
        </p>  
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            <strong>Consistent</strong>: A recommendation system can provide consistent advice and guidance to students, regardless of the counselor's workload or experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Accessible:</strong> A recommendation system can be accessed 24/7, making it more accessible to students who may not have the time or resources to visit a counselor in person.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            <strong>Data-driven:</strong> A recommendation system can use data and analytics to continuously improve the relevance and accuracy of its recommendations, providing students with the most up-to-date information.
        
        </p>
        
        <p>

            <strong>Unbiased:</strong> A recommendation system can provide unbiased recommendations, free from personal biases or opinions that may influence the advice provided by a counselor.
